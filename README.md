A Streamlit-based chat UI that wraps a Strands agent to provide UCLA-focused help (clubs, academics, career resources). This repo contains the Streamlit front-end and a small bruin_buddy agent wrapper. The app streams agent replies, shows quick-action buttons, and uses UCLA colors in the UI.

Overview

Friendly, student-focused assistant for UCLA students (clubs, career, campus questions).

Built with Streamlit for the UI and an agent (via bruin_buddy.get_agent()) for routing/searching knowledge bases.

Uses @st.cache_resource to keep the agent instance resident and streams outputs to the UI.
